# Welcome to our group repository

## General information

In this repository we will solve the Exercises from the second Assignment.
Furthermore all Links to every solution will be provided in this [README](./README.md) file.

## Group information

* For better communication within the group there is a file called [tasklist.md](./tasklist.md) in which we will list all the To-do tasks to finish our job. So **before starting to work** check the [To-do list](./tasklist.md).

* Every group member has its own branch to use while working! This allows us to work simultaniously on the same document without breaking or loosing our data.
  * **Usage:**
    1. **Before starting to work** making sure to be in the right branch by typing: `git checkout [YourBranchname]`. (To list all available branches type: `git branch`)

    2. Make sure to update your branch with the master branch before starting to work by using: `git merge master`

    3. After saving the files, adding them to the queue and commiting them, type the following to return to the master branch: `git checkout master`.

    4. From there you need to merge your work with the master branch with this command: `git merge[YourBranchname]`.

    5. In case this command returns a error code that states that the same file was changed elsewhere, please make sure to compare both and decide which one is the better one or what could be merged.

    6. Finally finish your work by pushing it with the following command: `git push`.

# Assignment 2

Second Assignment, Deadline: 2020-07-31, 23:59:59

In this assignment, you will work together in groups on a larger project that builds over several weeks.
The project will focus on getting data from the web, cleaning and writing data in Python.
The exercises will be posted in GitHub as usual.

## Rules

:heavy_check_mark: **Groups of 3 to 4**: You will work on this assignment in groups of 3 to 4 students each. Find your partners until 2020-06-04. Anyone not in a group by then will be assigned a random group by us.

:heavy_check_mark: **Be active**: As before, we want to see weekly commits from each of you in your repository. A last-minute commit for the assignment is suspicious...

:heavy_check_mark: **Everybody contributes equally**: You decide how to share the work in a group, but make sure that every member does roughly the same amount of work. If possible, make use of GitHub's collaboration features - e.g., one group member can be the designated "merge master" that receives pull requests and decides over code merges. Other modes of operation are possible, you decide - but we will eventually see in your commit log, who did what and when!

:heavy_check_mark: **Documentation, documentation, documentation**: Write a complementing `README.md` that explains your solutions, ideas, and so on. This will help the reviewers to understand what you did.

### :warning: If we get the feeling that you cheated, we will ask embarrassing questions and schedule a 1:1 interview! If you can’t explain your results in an 1:1 interview we will not accept your solutions and erase your points for this assignment

So... Play fair!
