## Exercise 1

We continue with the Lord of the Rings data set and try to reproduce some of the exercises we did with shell and grep.

0. Read chapter 8 to learn more about reading and writing files. I skipped a lot of details.
1. Write a Python program that extracts a full list of all character names that are listed in column "char".
2. Extend your program to count the character names. Save the names and corresponding counts in a dictionary.
3. Write the results in a new CSV file that contains the names and the counts.
4. Do the same steps 1-3 again, but count the character names that appear in the column "dialog". Think about different name variations (like uppercase, etc.).

Commit your Python program and the resulting CSV files.
